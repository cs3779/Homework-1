# Homework 1 - Problem 1

## Creating Data Frame

``` r
hw_df = tibble(
  rand_var = rnorm(8),
  logic_vec = rand_var > 0,
  char_vec = as.character(logic_vec,8),
  fact_vec = factor(char_vec, 3)
  )

mean(pull(hw_df, rand_var))
```

    ## [1] 0.4115145

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df, logic_vec))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw_df, fact_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw_df, fact_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Trying to take the mean for *rand\_var* (numeric) and *logic\_vec*
(logical) were both successful. The mean of *logic\_vec* might be the
mean of the variables that came back TRUE if its value are greater than
0. Meanwhile, it was not possible to take the mean (i.e. came back as
‘**N/A**’) for *char\_vec* or *fact\_vec* as they are both neither
numeric nor logical. The only two types of variable that the mean
function works on are numeric or logical.

### Dataframe Variable Conversion

``` r
# Converting logical vector to numeric
logic_to_numeric = as.numeric(hw_df$logic_vec)
prod_log_num = logic_to_numeric * (hw_df$rand_var)

# Converting logical vector to factor
logic_to_factor = as.factor(hw_df$logic_vec)
prod_log_fact = logic_to_factor * (hw_df$rand_var)

#Converting logical vector to factor then numeric
logic_factor_numeric = as.numeric(logic_to_factor)
prod_log_fact_num = logic_factor_numeric * (hw_df$rand_var)
```

Trying to take the means of the converted variables indicates that you
can only take the mean of a numeric variable since the output for the
mean of the *prod\_log\_fact* variable was ‘**N/A**’ - similar to above.
